# Coffee Exports ETL Pipeline & Visualization App â˜• co

This project is a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline combined with a Flask web application for visualizing Colombian coffee exports.
It extracts data from an Excel file, transforms and cleans the data, loads it into a database, and then displays interactive visualizations via a Flask application.
ETL python code applies OOP concepts.

## Features

- **ETL Pipeline:**  
  - Extracts data from an Excel file (`Exportations.xlsx`).
  - Transforms and cleans the data using Pandas.
  - Loads the cleaned data into a SQL database.
  
- **Flask Visualization App ðŸ“ˆ**  
  - Displays interactive graphs (generated with Plotly) showing coffee export trends.
  - Provides updated visualizations based on ETL data.
  
- **Automated Scheduling:**  
  - Uses cron to run the ETL pipeline every two weeks (Original source is updated once a month).
  
- **Production Deployment:**
  - Deployed in AWS ec2 instance.   
  - Served with Gunicorn as a WSGI server.
  - Managed by systemd for automatic start/restart.
  - Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to route incoming HTTP requests to the Flask app.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**: Main programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for the visualization app.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and ETL.
- **Plotly**: Interactive graph generation.
- **SQLAlchemy / sqlite3**: Database connectivity.
- **Gunicorn**: Production-grade WSGI server.
- **systemd**: Process management (service file for Gunicorn).
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy server.
- **Cron**: Scheduling ETL jobs.
